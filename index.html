        <h1>Corpus Hacks</h1>
        <h3>April 23rd, Community Room @ SJPL Biblioteca Latinoamericana Branch Library</h3>
        <p> 
		Corpus Hacks is a 12-hour student-run hackathon for middle and high 
		school students in the Bay Area that encourages participation from female and non-binary students. 
		Participants will receive free swag, 
		prizes and food. We hope to provide participants with an inclusive environment where 
		they can engage in workshops, learn from industry experts, find peers with similar 
		interests in computer science, and develop their coding skills in a stress-free setting.

        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
            Corpus Hacks aims to help bridge the gender gap in the field of computer science 
		and technology—despite being a rapidly growing field, in 2021, only 21% of 
		computer scientists in the United States were women. Through Corpus Hacks, 
		we want to increase this percentage by providing an opportunity for marginalized 
		genders to further explore their interest in STEM.
