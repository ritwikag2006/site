        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
            Corpus Hacks aims to help bridge the gender gap in the field of computer science 
		and technology—despite being a rapidly growing field, in 2021, only 21% of 
		computer scientists in the United States were women. Through Corpus Hacks, 
		we want to increase this percentage by providing an opportunity for marginalized 
		genders to further explore their interest in STEM.
